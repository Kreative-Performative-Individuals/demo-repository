# requirements.txt
# This file contains outdated dependencies intentionally for testing purposes.

# Why Trivy flags this:
# - Trivy performs Software Composition Analysis (SCA) by checking dependencies
#   against vulnerability databases like the NVD or GitHub Advisory Database.
# - The following outdated dependencies have known vulnerabilities:
#   - requests==2.19.1: Vulnerable to CVE-2018-18074 (open redirect issue).
#   - flask==0.12: Vulnerable to CVE-2018-1000656 (crafted JSON attacks).

# Why Bandit does not flag this:
# - Bandit performs static code analysis and does not analyze dependency files 
#   like requirements.txt. It focuses only on Python source code for issues like 
#   insecure API usage or hardcoded secrets.

# Vulnerable dependencies:
requests==2.19.1  # Known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2018-18074)
flask==0.12       # Known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2018-1000656)
